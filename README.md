# Qwerty
School project for the automata course.



## Some language features

- All variables are immutable
- Functions can be called partially, with logic defined for unfilled parameters
- Return statements
- Conditional branching
- Implicit for loops
- while loops
- And more

## Future ideas

- Multi file usage, this can be done by combining multiple IR's and symbol tables using several files.
- Classes and custom types
- standard library
- Sum types and generics

## Running an example

### Windows

```bash
compile_and_run.bat .\Example\example.txt
```
